## Code
- seems to have a lot of planes scheduled at the same point, seems when scheduling not checking they're taken properly
- more comments would be nice
- mutexes are considered less difficult than rw locks

## Report
- you can't say concurrency on airports increases system throughput since only one command can be sent to the airports at a time
- locking isnt really explained in much detail
